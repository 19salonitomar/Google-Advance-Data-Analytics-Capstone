Gather information pertaining to a business problem or an organizational inquiry 

Conduct exploratory data analysis

Build statistical data models and machine learning models

Consider ethical issues related to the task

Present your findings for a general audience of stakeholders

# About the company
Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifortâ€™s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.        

# Your business case
As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, you have received the results of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has tasked you with analyzing the data to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they would like you to design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their  department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points you deem helpful

# Capstone Project: Employee Retention Prediction for Salifort Motors
# Project Overview
Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. This capstone project involves analyzing the results of a recent employee survey to increase employee retention. The objective is to design a model predicting whether an employee will leave the company.

### Data Analysis and Model Building

In this section, we delve into the steps taken to analyze the employee survey data and build a predictive model for employee retention.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To gain insights into the dataset and better understand its characteristics, an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted. This involved:

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Examining summary statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, for key features like department, number of projects, and average monthly hours.
  
- **Data Visualization:** Utilizing visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices to identify patterns, outliers, and potential relationships between variables.

#### Feature Selection

Careful consideration was given to the features that would contribute most significantly to predicting employee retention. The following features were selected for inclusion in the predictive model:

1. **Department:** Analyzing the impact of department on employee retention.
2. **Number of Projects:** Assessing the correlation between workload and retention.
3. **Average Monthly Hours:** Investigating the relationship between work hours and the likelihood of leaving.

#### Model Building

The predictive model was constructed using [choose either regression model or tree-based machine learning model]. The rationale behind this choice is [provide reasoning based on project requirements, model interpretability, and performance considerations].

The following steps were taken in the model-building process:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
  
2. **Model Selection:** Choosing the most suitable model based on the nature of the problem and dataset. [Provide details on the chosen model, e.g., linear regression, decision tree, etc.]

3. **Training and Validation:** Splitting the dataset into training and validation sets to train and assess the model's performance.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Employing relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to evaluate the model's effectiveness in predicting employee retention.

#### Model Interpretation

Interpreting the model results is crucial for deriving actionable insights. The following aspects were considered:

- **Feature Importance:** Identifying which features have the most significant impact on the prediction.

- **Confusion Matrix and Metrics:** Assessing how well the model performs in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

### Conclusion

Summarize the key findings from the data analysis and model-building phase. Discuss any challenges encountered and highlight the implications of the results for employee retention strategies.

This section aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the methodology applied to analyze the data and build the predictive model for the capstone project.
